I worked on a site for a Hungarian bowling pub called, Santa Bowl. I delivered a fast and light website with the necessary informations. I made a unique logo for them and they made a big version to put on the pub's building.

You can see the site here:  https://adammartona.github.io/Bowling-Pub-Website-Full-2017/.
